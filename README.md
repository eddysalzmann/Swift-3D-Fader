Swift 3D Fader
===

Unnecessary image squencer for 3D faders. I don't recommend using this in production, just for fun so you can learn how image sequences work.
See also the knob example: https://github.com/eddysalzmann/Swift-3d-Knob

## How it works
This technique is based on an image sequence that gets triggered as soon as somebody moves the fader up and down.

```

...

```
